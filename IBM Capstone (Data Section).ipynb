I will use http://zipatlas.com/us/tx/austin/zip-code-comparison/population-density.htm for population data. Downloadable .CSV will correlate neighborhoods to each zip code. Foursquare will be utilized to obtain and filter out venue categories by competition. A final DataFrame combining all the desired data will be constructed to compare all the different factors mentioned above. A conclusion will be made based on this data.**\n\n**This analysis will provide a recommendation based on the factors listed above. There are, however, plenty of other factors one should consider before opening a restaurant, for instance: initial capital, management team, marketing & advertisement, equipment costs, design, and professional fee\u2019s to name a few.**",
