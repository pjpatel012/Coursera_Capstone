The reason I chose the city of Austin, TX is because it\u2019s recognized as one of the fastest growing cities in the USA and constantly ranked as one of the best places to live in the country as well. The restaurant business is highly competitive and cut-throat. This is why market research is necessary to mitigate risk before taking on such a significant financial risk, especially when it\u2019s a well-known fact that approximately 90% of restaurants fail within the first year.**\n",
